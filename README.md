# greenhouse-simulation

This is my final project for EEPS 0250: "Computational Approaches to Modelling and Quantitative Analysis in Natural Sciences: An Introduction," taught by Professor Christian Huber of Brown University's Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences.

In this project, I sought to model the Greenhouse Effect, widely understood to be the current driver of anthropogenic climate change, on a simulated planet. I used the Daisy World, a common model in environmental sciences with only barren ground, white daisies, and black daisies. Using Runge-Kutta and Euler discretizations, I visualized in MATLAB various effects of the Greenhouse Effect on the Daisy World, including constant effects, linearly increasing effects, and various emission mitigation strategies by the planet's inhabitants. These visualizations generated key insights which I connected to climate policy on Earth. 

This project demonstrates by ability to discretize differential equations, model them in computer programming scripts, iteratively develop virtual experiments and generate comparative visualizations, and extrapolate the results of these experiments to real life.
